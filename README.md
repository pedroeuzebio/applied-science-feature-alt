This article proposes a workload-reducing algorithm for cervical cancer detection based on analysis of cell nuclei features within Pap smear images published at Applied Science. We investigate eight traditional machine learning methods to perform a hierarchical classification. We propose a methodology for computer-aided screening of cell lesions, which can recommend fields of view from the microscopy image based on the nuclei detection of cervical cells.
